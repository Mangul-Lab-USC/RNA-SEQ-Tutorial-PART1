# RNA-SEQ-Tutorial-PART1

This repository contains three things:

1) A jupyter notebook that should be uploaded to your personal google colaboratory workspace. The reason for this is because we set it up so that it is the perfect environment for running these tools. No debugging necessary and you don't have to change the state of your personal computer. Please follow the instructions in the powerpoint for how to proceed.

2) The RNA sequencing data for this tutorial on performing a differential expression analysis.

3) A powerpoint tutorial.
